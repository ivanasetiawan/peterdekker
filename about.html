We are specialised in antique Chinese swords, Asian composite bows, and antique arms and armor of the Qing dynasty.

He believes in a practical approach that combines researching period accounts, texts and artwork with the study of antique artifacts and gaining practical experience by reproducing, testing and using such gear. As an archer Peter is researching and reconstructing the Manchu style, a practical military style of archery that was introduced into China during the founding of the Qing dynasty. He wrote several <a>articles</a> on the subject and presented workshops and lectures on archery <a>events</a> around the world.</p> <p>Among the skills Peter picked up on the side are reproducing tengpai, traditional Chinese rattan shields, arrow making, arrow restoration, light restorations on antique weapons. He may mastered various methods of grip wrapping for Chinese hilted weapons. Peter's wraps are appreciated by martial artists, professional restorers and antique collectors for both their looks and durability.</p> <p>For grip grapping turorial and services, see our grip wrapping page.
